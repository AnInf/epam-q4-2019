            "Description": "A team of expert divers will continue looking for the last two missing victims of the White Island eruption on Saturday, after the New Zealand Defence Force and police recovered six bodies from the island on Friday\u00a0in a high-risk operation.\u00a0 Deputy Commissioner of Police Mike Clement had warned that \u201ca lot will have to go right\u201d for the mission to succeed, and scientists had alerted police to a 50-60 per cent chance of another eruption, but the operation went to plan.\u00a0 On Friday morning Police Commissioner Mike Bush said in a statement that \u201cat least one body is in the water\u201d and divers on the police vessel Deodar were attempting to recover that body.\u00a0 \u201cWe're making every effort to locate and recover the two remaining deceased,\u201d Commissioner Bush said.\u201cThis has been a harrowing event for the Whakatane community and those family and friends directly impacted by the eruption of White Island [also known as Whakaari] on Monday,\u201d he said. This aerial photo shows White Island after its volcanic eruption in New Zealand Monday, Dec. 9, 2019 Credit: George Novak/New Zealand Herald \u201cThe operation today went to plan and we would like to recognise our partners at NZDF who have provided the specialist skills and resources to help us deliver this part of the operation\u2026 The operation was not without risk but thanks to sound planning and the skills of the specialist team involved we have recovered the six bodies.\u201d Commissioner Bush said the environment the recovery team faced was \u201chighly unpredictable and challenging\u201d. GNS Science volcanologist Graham Leonard had warned that in addition to the risk of eruption, the mission would face an environment in which it would, at times, be difficult to breathe and see. Pictures of the recovery operation showed pairs of military personnel wearing breathing apparatus scouring the lunar-like landscape as inflatable dinghies and a police launch waited offshore.

Speaking to reporters after the six bodies were retrieved, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said questions over why people were allowed to visit the active volcano \u201cmust be answered, and will be answered\u201d.\u00a0 New Zealand volcano An investigation is being conducted on behalf of the coroner, and an occupational health and safety investigation is also being conducted by WorkSafe, New Zealand\u2019s peak workplace safety organisation. \u00a0The Prime Minister said the time would come for accountability, but added \u201cwe also need to respect the phase we're in now, with families only just getting their loved ones back\u201d. There are now 14 confirmed dead from the tragedy. Twenty-six people remain in hospital receiving intensive medical treatment for severe burns, the majority of whom are in critical condition. The volcano, a popular tourist destination for day-trippers, erupted on Monday, spewing ash, steam and gases over the island. Among the 47 people on the island at the time were Australian, US, German, Chinese, British and Malaysian tourists.",

Peterson of Michigan \u2014 voted with House leadership. Amidst concerns from moderates, who on Monday considered reviving a proposal to censure President Trump rather than impeach him, the fate of the impeachment vote is a bit less certain.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could afford to lose 17 votes and still prevail with the vote, which will likely get the approval of former Republican Justin Amash. But House leadership is not whipping votes to ensure success, despite Pelosi saying in July that \u201ccensure is nice, but it is not commensurate with the violations of the Constitution should we decide [impeachment is] the way to go.\u201d\u201cThis is one of those issues where members have to come to their own conclusions; it\u2019s just too consequential,\u201d Daniel Kildee (D., Mich.), a deputy whip, said. \u201cI think this is one of those votes where people are going to be remembered for a long time for how they voted on it.\u201dModerates who initially voiced support for impeachment have been worried over polling which shows that support for impeachment has largely flatlined after the public hearings, the Post reports. Republican efforts to reclaim the House in 2020 have zeroed in on impeachment to target vulnerable districts, with the White House joining in in October.On Tuesday, freshman Representative Elissa Slotkin (D., Mich.) \u2014 who represents a district which voted for Trump in 2016 \u2014 said she was \u201cundecided\u201d on the vote, despite signing a September op-ed in support of impeachment. Slotkin was heckled by constituents during a town hall in October for her impeachment defense, and said Wednesday that \u201cthe phones are ringing off the hook\u201d from people on both sides of the issue.",

            "Link": "https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-aren-t-feeding-impeachment-231241142.html",
            "Description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the House Judiciary Committee continues to consider the articles of impeachment, many close\u00a0observers are\u00a0saying that Democrats are all too content to\u00a0sit on the sidelines while Republicans slam the proceedings as a sham.\u00a0That\u2019s not entirely true, of course. When Republicans argued that Congress should always defer to the courts when presidents defy House subpoenas, California\u2019s Zoe Lofgren gave an extremely strong defense of the rights of Congress, while also noting that President Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the investigation was made without raising any particular privilege. In other words, Trump and the House aren\u2019t arguing over a particular point of constitutional interpretation; Trump is simply asserting that he doesn\u2019t have to cooperate if he doesn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s something, as Lofgren argued, that\u2019s up to Congress to remedy.\u00a0But in several cases, Democrats are letting thing go.\u00a0Journalist Marcy Wheeler, who knows this material as well as anyone, is among those frustrated.\u00a0She recently tweeted, \u201cDems are really acting negligent here. There\u2019s so much to respond to this one.\u201dIs she right? Are Democrats being negligent or simply getting rolled? Or\u00a0have they made\u00a0a strategic choice?There is some upside to\u00a0allowing Republicans to rant on and on \u2014 especially the ones who prefer to shout. At a certain point, the objections begin to sound like white noise, or the mumbly adults in Charlie Brown\u2019s world.\u00a0If Democrats were to challenge them, it would elevate the Republican points and bait the news media into presenting bland reports about \u201cboth sides\u201d of the debate \u2014\u00a0a debate that they would rather not have.\u00a0Instead, Democrats are typically using their time to make their case for impeaching Trump.\u00a0That\u2019s not a bad strategy given the alternative.\u00a0The media loves to do political analysis \u2014\u00a0how the impeachment is playing, what the electoral implications are \u2014\u00a0rather than just saying what happened.(2) And especially when the likely outcome in the Senate is an acquittal, the House procedures are likely to produce stories about the futility of the Democrats\u2019 actions, rather than about what Democrats see as the extent of Trump\u2019s malfeasance and the importance of impeachment.\u00a0At the same time, Republicans appear to be mainly concerned not with convincing anyone, but in producing talking points for Republican-aligned media. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t mind repeating entirely discredited assertions, such as the claim that former Vice President Joe Biden was attempting to stop an investigation into his son\u2019s company by getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired when in fact Biden was \u2014\u00a0as the witnesses all said \u2014\u00a0trying to get Ukraine to replace a corrupt prosecutor who wasn\u2019t investigating that company with one who would fight corruption. What this means is that even when Democrats do counter Republican points, it won\u2019t change anything.Granted, it is very frustrating to those who are watching along at home and seeing opportunities for their side to score debating points. For better or worse, that\u2019s not how anyone keeps score of these kinds of events.(1) Not that I'm complaining; that's a lot of what I do here at Opinion.

            "Date": "2019-12-12 10:47:32-05:00",
            "Link": "https://news.yahoo.com/iraq-mob-lynches-16-old-154732601.html",
            "Description": 'An angry mob killed a 16-year-old and strung up the corpse by its feet from a traffic pole after the teen shot and killed six people on Thursday, including four anti-government protesters, Iraqi officials said. Dozens of people pointed their cellphones at the body dangling high above them in a central Baghdad square. Videos circulating on social media showed the young man being beaten and dragged across the street. The violence underscored the growing fears and suspicions swirling around the 8-week-old protest movement, which engulfed Iraq on October 1 when thousands took to the streets to decry government corruption, poor services and scarcity of jobs. A string of mysterious acts of bloodshed by unknown groups has put anti-government protesters on edge and eroded their faith in the ability of state security forces to protect them. Last Friday, 25 protesters were killed when gunmen in pickup trucks opened fire in Baghdad\'s Khilani Square. That same week, mysterious knife attacks targeted over a dozen anti-government protesters in Tahrir Square, the hub of the protest movement. In recent days, abductions and assassinations of high-profile civil activists have stoked paranoia among demonstrators. Protesters largely blame Iran-backed militias for the attacks and see the violence as a campaign to instill fear and weaken their peaceful movement. Thursday\'s bloodshed began when the young gunman opened fire in Baghdad\'s Wathba Square, killing two shop owners and four protesters. Security officials said the teen was wanted by police on drug-related charges and was running from security forces at the time. An enraged mob beat the young man to death, security and health officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. At least eight people were wounded, the officials said. Influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called those who killed the teen "terrorists" and warned that if they were not identified within 48 hours, he would order his militia to leave the square. Members of Saraya Salam, or Peace Brigades, are deployed in the square to protect protesters. Protesters refer to them as the "blue hats." The killing of the teenager was condemned by the wider protest movement in Tahrir Square, which said in a statement that the perpetrators were not part of their peaceful demonstrations. "We can\'t allow the image of our pure revolution to be distorted, so we declare that we are innocent as peaceful demonstrators to what happened this morning in Wathba Square," the statement said.',

            "Description": "Employees at a fish farm in Vancouver intervened when an eagle tried to eat a large octopus, resulting in a battleA bald eagle on Canada\u2019s west coast has learned that its eyes may be bigger than its stomach after it was nearly drowned by an octopus it tried to eat.After hearing shrieks coming from the water on the north-western tip of Vancouver Island, employees at a fish farm investigating the noises happened upon a bird and cephalopod locked in battle.The octopus, which had turned a deep crimson, had wound its tentacles tightly around the eagle, which was floating helplessly at the surface.\u201cAt first we just watched and we didn\u2019t know if we should interfere because, you know, it\u2019s Mother Nature,\u201d said John Ilett, an employee at Mowi West Canada, told CTV News.But realizing the eagle was likely to drown, the crew ultimately decided to intervene.Ilett maneuvered a pike pole in the water to pull the octopus over to the boat. The crew managed to haul both aboard, disentangling the bird from the strong tentacles, before tossing the octopus back into the water.\u201cThat was amazing. Look at the size of this [expletive],\u201d said one worker as the octopus hovered briefly at the surface.\u201cHoly [expletive],\u201d another worker adds as the crew laughs in disbelief.Workers said the octopus was the largest theyhad ever encountered, and probably measured more than four and a half feet across.But much larger individuals lurk in the deeps: octopuses in the region \u2013 including the giant Pacific octopus \u2013 can grow to more than 25ft in diameter.After the eagle was pried from its grasp, the octopus dove back into the depths, its colours subtly shifting from reddish to brown.The shaken eagle perched warily on a nearby log before flying off.\u201cIt was a very cool situation,\u201d said Ilett. \u201cI\u2019ve been out here 20 years and that\u2019s one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",

            "Description": '(Bloomberg) -- In a television commercial that\u2019s become part of the lore surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s affinity for McDonald\u2019s Corp., he embraced a purple, lumpy denizen of the fast-food chain\u2019s \u201cMcDonaldland\u201d and said, \u201cTogether, Grimace, we could own this town.\u201dHe was talking about New York, not Washington. Yet on Thursday, some 17 years after he appeared in that spot for the \u201cBig \u2019N\u2019 Tasty\u201d sandwich, President Trump\u2019s appointees delivered a high-stakes political victory for McDonald\u2019s in one of the most important labor disputes in decades.The national board that referees union-organizing drives effectively absolved the company of liability for alleged labor-law violations in some of its franchisees\u2019 restaurants, easing a major threat to the fast-food giant\u2019s business structure. Trump\u2019s appointees overrode an agency judge and rebuffed ethical concerns raised by labor advocates to approve a group of settlements in the matter on a 2-1 decision. The deal resolves allegations of wrongdoing without holding the corporation legally liable as \u201cjoint employer\u201d with its franchisees.The victory, which eluded McDonald\u2019s during Obama\u2019s presidency, could help the fast-food giant close a bruising chapter in its history that imperiled its valuable brand as well as the franchise structure it\u2019s built on.\u00a0\u00a0In an emailed statement, McDonald\'s Corp. said it was \u201cpleased\u201d\u00a0that the case had been concluded, and that the decision \u201callows our franchisees and their employees to move forward, and resolves all matters without any admission of wrongdoing.\u201dSeparately, top administration officials, including acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, are pushing to enact new, more lenient rules that would help insulate McDonald\u2019s and similar chains from liability for the conduct of their franchisees. \u201cPresident Trump has made deregulation a priority across the administration, which has helped unleash unprecedented economic and job growth,\u201d\u00a0White House spokesman Judd Deere said.There\u2019s no sign that Trump has personally intervened in the NLRB\u2019s McDonald\u2019s case. Regardless, the case stands apart\u2014both in terms of its history and its potential repercussions.During a messy, multi-year saga, the company became a focal point in the \u201cFight for $15\u201d movement to increase pay and unionize fast-food workers, among others. As protests engulfed McDonald\u2019s restaurants, a corporate team responded by organizing a central effort to help franchisees push back against the union, according to evidence submitted in the case. Workers eventually complained to the NLRB, alleging that the tactics franchisees used amounted to illegal retaliation for engaging in federally protected union activities. In 2014, the board\u2019s general counsel found enough merit in the workers\u2019 claims to issue formal complaints against a group of franchisees, complaints that also accused McDonald\u2019s of acting as a \u201cjoint employer\u201d with them. McDonald\u2019s and the franchisees have denied any illegal retaliation or other unfair practices.\u00a0McDonald\u2019s has called the allegations baseless and argued that\u00a0it can\u2019t be legally held responsible for decisions of its franchisees, who run more than 90% of McDonald\u2019s restaurants and set their own wages and hiring practices. Franchisees denied the allegations as well.\u00a0\u00a0In the board\u2019s ruling Thursday, two Trump appointees approved proposed settlements that provide back pay to McDonald\'s workers but do not hold McDonald\'s Corp. liable as a "joint employer." In their decision, the members wrote that the deal would "remedy every violation alleged" in the government\u2019s complaints against McDonald\'s."Moreover, we conclude that further litigation would impose a substantial burden on the parties, without a significant probability of prevailing on the complaint\u2019s joint-employer allegation," board members\u00a0Marvin Kaplan and William Emanuel said in the ruling.Union advocates had lodged a formal petition with the board arguing that Emanuel\u00a0needed to recuse from the case because he worked at a law firm that McDonald\u2019s hired to counter the Fight for $15 organizing and protest efforts.Emanuel "has considered the motion and has determined, in consultation with the Board\u2019s Designated Agency Ethics Official, not to recuse himself," according to the ruling, which noted that his firm had not been representing McDonald\u2019s or franchisees in the NLRB case itself. Last month, Board Chairman John Ring \u2014 who also came from a law firm that has worked for McDonald\u2019s \u2014 revamped ethics policies that might have made it harder for him or Emanuel to participate in the case. As it turned out, Ring was not part of the three-member panel that ruled on the McDonald\u2019s decision.In a dissent, the NLRB\'s sole Democrat, Lauren McFerran, said the settlements were "unreasonable," and that with McDonald\'s joint-employer status unaddressed, "it is likely that similar issues will arise in the future."The decision represents a setback for the Service Employees International Union, which since 2012 has backed the \u201cFight for $15\u201d protests. The SEIU\u2019s president, Mary Kay Henry, pledged to appeal any adverse decision.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot more than a politically motivated decision on behalf of a Trump administration doing McDonald\u2019s bidding to stop the workers of the Fight for $15,\u201d Henry said in a statement.The board\'s vote\u00a0also means that the corporation\u2019s moves to help resist the protests and unionization effort have received, more or less, tacit acceptance from federal regulators. Those tactics, which were discussed by and, at times, coordinated by regional executives of the company, included gathering intelligence from a cashier who attended a union meeting as a mole, circulating names of suspected pro-union workers and coaching a franchisee on how to avoid hiring union sympathizers, according to excerpts from thousands of previously unreported documents and internal emails. The documents, which were provided to the NLRB by McDonald\u2019s and several franchisees under a federal judge\u2019s subpoena, reveal an inside look at how McDonald\u2019s corporate staff members\u00a0worked with franchisees on strategies to fight the union.McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t respond to specific questions about several allegations, but said in a statement to Bloomberg News that the case is \u201cincredibly complex\u201d and that the \u201cevidence is vast and complicated, and requires significant context to accurately and responsibly consider.\u201d The company took issue with Bloomberg\u2019s summary of that evidence, saying, \u201cWhat you have highlighted are selective allegations and asserted them as facts, when there has been no judicial decision or review.\u201d\u00a0Last year, as she rejected a proposed settlement in the case, an administrative judge for the NLRB found\u00a0that the case contained \u201ccopious evidence pertinent to McDonald\'s activities in order to provide resources and support for its franchisees throughout the country in response to the Fight for $15 campaign.\u201d Specifically, Judge\u00a0Lauren Esposito\u00a0wrote that the case included \u201cevidence that McDonald\u2019s response to the Fight for $15 campaign was formulated and implemented from its corporate headquarters.\u201d On Thursday, the board ordered her to accept the settlement.The joint-employer question at the heart of the NLRB case carries profound implications. In 2015, in a different case that didn\u2019t involve McDonald\u2019s, the NLRB issued a ruling that would make it easier to hold companies accountable for franchisees\u2019 mistreatment of workers. By 2017, that issue was seen as so dire\u2014not just for McDonald\u2019s, but for franchise operations generally\u2014that the then-chair of the International Franchise Association compared it to the 9/11 terror attacks.\u00a0While fighting McDonald\u2019s at the NLRB, the union has opened other fronts too, arguing the company should share any liability for a range of alleged transgressions inside franchised stores. Recently, dozens of workers have alleged sexual harassment in the chain\u2019s restaurants in lawsuits or complaints filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In August, McDonald\u2019s announced an \u201coperator-led, company-supported\u201d training initiative for 850,000 workers across the country to help ensure \u201csafe and respectful\u201d workplaces.Last month, amid that latest rash of allegations, the company fired Chief Executive Stephen Easterbrook for engaging in a consensual relationship with an employee, a violation of company policy. During his almost five-year tenure atop McDonald\u2019s, Easterbrook presided over a sharp rise in the company\u2019s share price\u2014despite a decline in annual revenue to about $21 billion from $25\u00a0billion. The revenue changes stem from a \u201crefranchising\u201d strategy to sell corporate-owned stores to independent owners that began in 2015, according to McDonald\u2019s.\u00a0Over the same period, annual profit margins surged to about 28% from 17%, a jump driven partly by new innovations such as all-day breakfast, touch-screen ordering kiosks and home delivery.But in time, overseeing the company\u2019s reversal of fortune in Washington\u2014and preserving the liability buffer between the corporate headquarters and the franchisees\u2014may be viewed as Easterbrook\u2019s most lasting impact.\u00a0After being targeted by the Fight for $15 campaign for years, this March McDonald\u2019s announced that it would no longer fund lobbying efforts to prevent minimum wage increases. The company said in a letter that it would continue talking to lawmakers about how any increases should work, including that \u201call industries should be treated the same way.\u201d\u00a0In its statement, the company said it has \u201cmade significant investments in our people practices to provide employees at both McDonald\u2019s corporate-owned and franchise locations with opportunities for competitive wages, education and safe and respectful workplaces.\u201dAverage starting pay at its corporate-owned restaurants is $10 an hour, the company said\u2014well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour but well below the fought-for $15. The average starting wage equates to $20,800 over a year\u2019s worth of 40-hour weeks. \u201cWhile franchisees control wages in their restaurants, we believe they are similar and competitive,\u201d the company said.Most people remember Ray Kroc, who took McDonald\u2019s from a small, California-based chain to a global fast-food empire, for innovations in franchising, but he also pioneered the low-wage fast-food job. As he oversaw the chain\u2019s proliferation nationwide, the new restaurants staffed up with low-wage workers, many of them teenagers. Today, teens are a declining share of the food-service workforce; 18% of restaurant workers are aged 16 to 19, down from 20% in 2008, according to the National Restaurant Association, which projects additional declines by 2026.\u00a0About 90 percent of McDonald\u2019s 14,000 U.S. restaurants are franchises, a structure that keeps the company relatively asset-light and low-risk. The Trump administration is working on new rules that would reduce legal exposure for corporate franchisers. The proposals would make it harder, for example, to hold McDonald\u2019s Corp. liable, along with franchisees, if kitchen managers are accused of sexual harassment or workers claim they weren\u2019t paid overtime.\u00a0The structure also makes it nearly impossible for workers at franchised restaurants\u00a0to win the right to bargain collectively with McDonald\u2019s executives\u2014unless the NLRB determines that the corporation is indeed the workers\u2019 \u201cjoint employer.\u201d Without that, or a negotiated deal between the company and the union, any organizing\u00a0effort would have to take place in pieces, franchise by franchise. The risk that the corporation could simply drop any unionized franchise would make that even harder to accomplish.Over the years, the company has weathered its share of public relations challenges. French anti-globalization radicals bombed its restaurants. Animal-rights extremists distributed \u201cUnhappy Meals\u201d with a plastic chicken covered in fake blood. The 2001 book Fast Food Nation tied McDonald\u2019s to the obesity epidemic. But the Fight for $15 movement took place on a scale the company hadn\u2019t seen before.Beginning in 2012, in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations, a union-backed drive immersed McDonald\u2019s restaurants in street protests that eventually spread globally. Protesters jammed drive-thrus, chanted in restaurants, banged on windows and stood atop tables.\u00a0Corporate executives monitored developments as\u00a0managers helped orchestrate a years-long anti-union response across the U.S., according to an analysis of thousands of pages of documents filed in the national labor board\u2019s case. In 2014, the NLRB\u2019s Obama-era general counsel alleged that the company\u2019s subsidiary, McDonald\u2019s USA LLC, was liable as a joint employer for a nationwide pattern of anti-union activity that included franchisees making threats, conducting surveillance, cutting work hours and firing workers who sought better pay and working conditions.Signs of unionizing efforts began emerging in October 2012, as reflected in a memo about organizing activity that circulated via McDonald\u2019s internal email. \u201cSeems to be affiliation with Occupy Wall Street movement,\u201d said the document, which was in an email from a senior director of human resources. Soon,\u00a0notes about the union showed up on an internal McDonald\u2019s \u201cactivity log.\u201d Said one entry: \u201cWhite male talking to employees about affordable housing and asking questions about pay. Repeatedly in restaurant.\u201dAfter word of an upcoming union meeting surfaced, a cashier at one New York City McDonald\u2019s acted as a mole for the company, records show. She attended the meeting in Harlem, and by the next day, she\u00a0shared her findings: About a dozen workers signed up to be union leaders, a report on the incident said.\u201cThey said McD makes $Billions + only pay minimum wage,\u201d the worker reported. \u201c\u2026 Focus seems to be on young, attractive female cashiers that speak English well \u2026.\u201dOn Nov. 29, 2012, the Fight for $15 campaign made its first public splash with protests at fast-food restaurants across New York City as workers at McDonald\u2019s and other chains went on strike for the day. From there, protests spread nationwide, fueled by old-school organizing and social-media messaging. At the time, McDonald\u2019s had only a sparse social-media team and had yet to match the union in that capacity, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s operations.The company created fast, effective communications channels with franchisees to discuss the union\u2019s activities. In emails and text messages, its managers made plans to combat \u201cthe opposition\u201d and emphasized that some messages needed to be secret.\u201cThere is a sense of urgency regarding the gathering of this intel so that we can plan and prep the operators \u2026,\u201d said one email from a human resources director. \u201cAs a tip, you can text your operators regarding this message, however you have to instruct them to ERASE the message and response back to you, and you will need to do the same.\u201d McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t respond to questions about why recipients were advised to erase messages.In addition to a cadre of labor lawyers and several\u00a0public relations firms, McDonald\u2019s worked with \u201cunion avoidance\u201d strategists, records show. In one case, a regional executive shared with a franchisee strategies on how to identify and avoid \u201csalts,\u201d or people who try to get hired in order to help organize a workplace. Federal law restricts the organized avoidance of such hires.Corporate employees circulated names of workers thought to be supporting the union. Once, in 2013, the company dispatched a \u201cmobile security detail\u201d to several Manhattan franchisees\u2019 restaurants after receiving what an internal email described as \u201cintel\u201d about a possible Fight for $15 rally. The company told Bloomberg News that at times \u201csecurity may be necessary on-site at restaurants for the safety of our property, customers and/or employees.\u201dMore than once, a regional McDonald\u2019s executive organized gatherings\u00a0in downtown Chicago for franchisees to discuss the situation, internal emails show. Their choice of venue? A Ronald McDonald House, part of the nonprofit foundation whose stated mission is to \u201cimprove the health and well-being of children and their families.\u201dSince the unionization drive began, dozens of workers have filed complaints with the NLRB alleging elements of an anti-union culture in McDonald\u2019s restaurants. Emmanuel Flores, 28, told Bloomberg he saw just such a culture firsthand at a company-owned restaurant in Monterey Park, California.Flores said he endured months of lewd comments, sexual overtures and groping from supervisors and co-workers. Early this year, on the advice of a union organizer, he told his store manager about it.The next day, Flores said, his shift hours were cut. Days later, during an informal staff meeting with him and other workers, the manager compared union activists to \u201cleeches\u201d and said \u201cthat even if we got paid $15 an hour, it wouldn\u2019t matter because she would cut our hours,\u201d Flores said. Flores filed complaints with California officials and the EEOC, and he was named as a witness in a retaliation complaint that the union filed with the NLRB.\u00a0Trump\u2019s fondness for McDonald\u2019s is no secret. During his 2016 campaign, it was part of his standard fare; one order consisted of \u201ctwo Big Macs, two Fillet-O-Fish, and a chocolate malted,\u2019\u2019 wrote his former campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie in their 2017 book, Let Trump Be Trump.McDonald\u2019s soon met with senior members of the new administration. In July 2017, Trump\u2019s first labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, sat down for dinner at The Smith, a popular restaurant near Capitol Hill, with Easterbrook and Sam Tatevosyan, the company\u2019s top lobbyist, according to the official Department of Labor calendar. The next day, Acosta and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin spoke at a McDonald\u2019s lobbying summit, records show. Acosta declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mnuchin.McDonald\u2019s said it hosts both Democrats and Republicans for such Washington meetings. \u201cThe company traditionally invites officials from the current administration to discuss topics relevant to the business\u2014and did the same during the Obama administration,\u201d the company said. \u00a0Once Trump\u2019s appointees began taking office, McDonald\u2019s sought to end its long struggle at the NLRB. In December 2017, a lawyer for the company emailed a letter to the board\u2019s new general counsel, Peter Robb. Robb prosecuted a landmark case against the American air traffic controllers\u2019 union during President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. The union was found to have engaged in an illegal strike, and Reagan fired more than 11,000 workers, a lasting blow to the American labor movement.\u201cOur request is straightforward,\u201d\u00a0said the McDonald\u2019s letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Bloomberg News. \u201cWe ask that you use your prosecutorial discretion to end this waste of taxpayer resources and consider what your predecessor would not consider\u2014a global resolution of the underlying unfair labor practice allegations.\u201d The lawyer asked for a resolution that would not designate McDonald\u2019s a \u201cjoint employer.\u201dWithin a few months, the company got what it asked for: Robb\u2019s office offered to settle the case with no joint-employer finding. The proposed settlement would have provided back pay to about 20 workers, in amounts ranging from about $30 to $50,000, and it required no admission of any wrongdoing. But the administrative judge overseeing the case, Esposito, rejected the settlement, calling it too lenient on the company.The White House in effect aided McDonald\u2019s in other ways. According to people who\u2019ve worked in the administration, Acosta drew Mulvaney\u2019s ire for dragging his feet on Labor Department rule changes, including making the agency\u2019s \u201cjoint employer\u201d standard more lenient. Colleagues thought Acosta was too concerned about provoking congressional Democrats, according to two people familiar with the situation. Trump\u2019s aides repeatedly pressed Acosta\u2019s staff during White House meetings about the status of the rules\u2014and Mulvaney largely replaced Acosta in the process, taking final say over the new rules\u2019 content and timing, the people said.\u00a0Mulvaney tends to get more involved in policy than previous chiefs of staff because of his dual role as White House budget director, according to a White House official who spoke on background. When his Office of Management and Budget pushes back on an agency\u2019s work, it\u2019s for good reasons, the official said.At the NLRB, Trump appointees have attempted to defang the joint-employer threat, despite encountering ethical snags. The Board tried in 2017 to overturn an Obama-era precedent on the issue, but then had to quickly invalidate that change after the agency\u2019s ethics officer found that one of Trump\u2019s appointees, Emanuel, had wrongly failed to recuse himself. The board is now trying to change the standard using its rulemaking authority instead.Meanwhile, Robb has asked board members to overturn the judge\u2019s rejection of his proposed McDonald\u2019s settlement. Union advocates lodged a formal petition with the board, arguing that two of Trump\u2019s appointees must recuse themselves from the case because they worked at law firms that McDonald\u2019s hired to counter the Fight for $15 organizing and protest efforts.On Nov. 19, the board\u2019s Trump-appointed chairman, John Ring, released what he called a \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d internal ethics review, which clears a path for the board to set\u00a0aside such objections. Ring is one of the two board members who\u2019ve been urged to recuse; while he came to the board from a law firm that worked for McDonald\u2019s, there\u2019s no evidence that he personally worked for the company.Ring\u2019s unusual \u201cethics recusal report\u201d last month concluded that each NLRB member can \u201cinsist on participating\u201d in cases even if federal ethics officials say otherwise. While the ethics officials\u2019 decisions may be binding, they\u2019re not \u201cself-enforcing,\u201d the report found. So NLRB board members can overrule them simply by disagreeing with their legal conclusions, Ring wrote. He didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The McDonald\u2019s case has generated 21,000 pages of trial transcript, with testimony from more than 100 witnesses.

            "Description": "A Washington state police officer once told a coworker he would \u201csay exactly what's on my mind, unless I'm on body camera.\u201d This week, his boast came back to haunt him. The Spokane Police Department suspended Officer Nathan Nash without pay after a domestic violence victim accused him of assaulting her, and a police investigation found he had turned off his body camera during the event.The investigation began in October, when a domestic violence victim told the police department Nash had sexually assaulted her in a follow-up call to her house. The woman says she called Nash to ask about the location of her evidence photos, according to court documents obtained by KXLY. Nash allegedly asked her to meet in a private place to \u201cgo over the bruises on her body\u201d and then pressed her to let him come over before her mother returned.\u00a0On his way to the woman\u2019s apartment, Nash allegedly turned off both his body camera and tracking equipment, resulting in a 36-minute location gap that a police analyst later described as \u201cpeculiar.\u201d Once inside, the woman says, Nash followed her into her bedroom and directed her to take off her pants and underwear. She told investigators she was confused by the request, but complied because he was a police officer.\u00a0The woman says Nash then penetrated her with his fingers for 30 seconds to a minute. She says she panicked, but thought it might be what he was supposed to do. Eventually, she says she told Nash \"OK, that's enough.\" She later told investigators the alleged assault was the worst thing that has ever happened\" to her.Before leaving, the woman says, he gave her his personal cellphone number. He did not photograph or otherwise document her bruises.When questioned by investigators, Nash blamed the incident on the domestic violence victim, suggesting that she had come on to him and become \u201cembarrassed, mad, or upset,\u201d when he ended the sexual contact, according to court documents. He added that the police department's body camera manual was more than 100 pages and \u201cthere's no way I'm gonna know all that content.\"\u00a0In a statement after Nash's arrest, his personal attorney Rocco Treppiedi said Nash \u201ccategorically denies the allegation of sexual assault and any criminal activity.\u201d \u201cOfc. Nash considered the additional evidence she provided, and immediately followed up on the information she provided,\u201d Treppiedi said. Nash\u2019s attorneys did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.In the weeks after the initial report, two more women came forward with concerns about Nash. One was a second domestic violence victim, who told investigators that Nash had come on to her while he was investigating her complaint in May.\u00a0During a visit to her home, the woman said, Nash made a point of turning off his bodycam, then gave her his personal cellphone number and said he would respond faster than 911. Over the following weeks, she says he friended her on Facebook and started liking photos of her in lingerie, and sending her \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cneedy\u201d messages. According to court documents, she told investigators she felt he \u201chad a hidden agenda of starting a relationship with her.\u201dA police department volunteer also complained about Nash, claiming he had given her his personal number and sent her inappropriate texts, including a Jeopardy-themed message reading, \u201cThings I would like to do to you for $600,\u201d and \u201cAnswer: what is a naked back rub?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m too old to play games, no need in beating around the bush,\u201d Nash allegedly wrote in another message. \u201cI just say exactly what\u2019s on my mind, unless I\u2019m on body camera.\"Nash was arrested on Nov. 22 and pleaded not guilty to second- and third-degree rape and official misconduct. His trial is set to begin in February.Nash was originally placed on administrative leave while the investigation progressed. This week, the police department put him on \u201cunpaid lay-off status,\u201d meaning he will not work or be paid until the outcome of his case is determined.\u00a0 If he is found not guilty, he will be reinstated while the department investigates whether he violated any department policy, City spokesperson Marlene Feist told local news station KREM.\u201cThe alleged conduct is completely unacceptable and in absolute conflict with the high standards of the Spokane Police Department,\u201d Chief Craig Meidl said in a press release. \u201cOur men and women took an oath to protect and serve the community in which we live.

She should be ashamed of this.\u201dUsing racist and xenophobic tropes, Barron responded that \u201cher district is actually one of the least American districts in the country, and by that, I don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not part of America, but it\u2019s occupied by relatively few American citizens.\u201dHe went on: \u201cThe way they inhabit housing there is such that they live in a lot of illegal spaces like basements, and many people live there, so they wind up producing a lot of garbage that the landlords don\u2019t want thrown out normally. Hence, you wind up with a lot of garbage on the streets. You have illegal food vendors pouring their pig grease in the gutters.\u201dIt was unclear where he was getting this information from.Carlson and his guests, much like the president, frequently imply that immigrants are making the country \u201cpoorer and dirtier\u201d.Carlson has called the idea of white supremacy in America a hoax.On Wednesday night on Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez shared video of the segment and wrote: \u201cI go back and forth on whether to go on Fox News.\u201dShe said: \u201cThe main reason I haven\u2019t is squaring the fact that the ad revenue from it bankrolls a white supremacist sympathizer to broadcast an hour-long production of unmitigated racism, without any accountability whatsoever.\u201dShe added: \u201c\u2018Immigrants are dirty\u2019 is a lazy, tired, racist trope.\u201dBarron later apologized on Twitter, saying he had not done \u201cjustice to a complicated issue\u201d of crowded housing conditions.",

            "Link": "https://news.yahoo.com/why-next-north-korea-crisis-210000945.html",
            "Description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Donald Trump is trading insults with Kim Jong-un, North Korea is launching missiles and no one\u2019s talking about disarmament. It\u2019s beginning to feel like the days of \u201cfire and fury\u201d are here again.Or maybe not. While Kim\u2019s nuclear arsenal is believed to have only grown more dangerous in the two years since Trump last threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the country, the geopolitical landscape has shifted in ways that may make the brinkmanship of 2017 less attractive to both men.For starters, a series of dovish moves by Trump -- including canceling a strike on Iran and withdrawing troops from Syria -- have undercut his threats of military action. Kim, meanwhile, must be careful he\u2019s not so provocative that he prompts more sanctions or loses the diplomatic profile he gained during his unprecedented detente with Trump.So, despite Kim\u2019s warning he\u2019ll take a \u201cnew path\u201d if Trump doesn\u2019t make a better offer in nuclear talks by the end of the year, he faces largely the same dilemma he has for most of 2019. How can he raise enough pressure on Trump to force a concession, without becoming an international pariah again?\u201cIt\u2019s neither in the U.S.\u2019s nor North Korea\u2019s interests to cross each other\u2019s red line,\u201d said Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. \u201cTrump would have to take measures that aren\u2019t necessarily politically beneficial for him, and North Korea knows that it won\u2019t be able to tolerate the response measures either.\u201dFor more than two years, North Korea has refrained from testing nuclear bombs or missiles capable of carrying them to the U.S. mainland -- something Trump touts as a key first-term achievement. The region has been bracing for an end to that lull since the president walked away from his second face-to-face meeting with Kim in February and North Korea kicked off what became a record year of shorter-range rocket tests.In recent days, the rhetoric has turned personal again, with Trump reviving his \u201cRocket Man\u201d nickname for Kim and a top North Korean official dismissing the U.S. president as a \u201cheedless and erratic old man.\u201d North Korea has said it was preparing a choice of \u201cChristmas\u201d gifts for Trump, with Kim expected to announce his judgment at an upcoming meeting of the Workers\u2019 Party in Pyongyang.Kelly Craft, the U.S.\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council on Wednesday that she saw \u201cdeeply troubling indications\u201d that North Korea was poised for a major provocation, including an ICBM test or space launch. Trump\u2019s top envoy for nuclear talks, Stephen Biegun, is expected to arrive Sunday in Seoul for what will likely be the U.S.\u2019s last chance to dial back tensions before the new year.Trump has so far played down North Korea\u2019s warnings, saying in a tweet that Kim was \u201ctoo smart and has far too much to lose\u201d to renew hostility with the U.S. A serious provocation would put more strain on the Republican leader during an election year, as Democrats seek to portray him as destabilizing to global security and too accommodating of autocrats like Kim.Still, North Korea has more rungs to climb before conducting its seventh nuclear test or launching its first ICBM since November 2017. First, Kim could simply announce that he was rescinding his moratorium on such tests -- an intermediate step North Korea has taken before scrapping previous freezes.\u201cThey will up the ante, but will calibrate it just enough so that the talks won\u2019t totally break down,\u201d said Yasuyo Sakata, a professor at Kanda University of International Studies. \u201cThe red line is that they cannot do a real intercontinental ballistic-missile test. But they can do satellite tests, for example.\u201dNorth Korea may have also signaled lesser potential provocations, including by conducting a Dec. 7 engine test at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground. South Korea sees a possibility of North Korea launching a satellite on a ballistic-missile class projectile before Christmas, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said this week, citing an unidentified government source.Kim could also fire an intermediate-range missile over U.S. ally Japan, something he last did in September 2017. Earlier this month, a North Korean diplomat released a statement warning that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may see a ballistic missile \u201cin the not distant future and under his nose.\u201dNorth Korea must take care not to alienate Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, who both wield Security Council vetoes and advocate sanctions relief for it. Xi in particular doesn\u2019t want trouble that may blow back across China\u2019s border with North Korea, including the threat of a regional war with the U.S. or American sanctions against Chinese banks.\u201cNo matter what we do, it should be conducive to reducing tension, to promoting dialogue, and thus prevent from falling back into confrontation,\u201d Zhang Jun, China\u2019s ambassador to the UN, told reporters after the Security Council meeting last week.There are some advantages for Kim in raising the heat on Trump through 2020, including demonstrating weapons technology that will better deter any U.S. invasion and establish North Korea as a nuclear state. He has likely found enough ways around international sanctions to keep his economy stable for the time being, UN observers have said.In the long run though, Kim probably needs to get out from under the sanctions if he wants to develop the industrial and tourism projects he promotes almost daily in state media. And he\u2019s unlikely to find a better U.S. negotiating partner than Trump, who has defied convention by meeting him and showering him with praise.\u201cIt is possible that North Korea wants to regroup while the U.S. presidential election plays out,\u201d said Naoko Aoki, an adjunct political scientist at RAND Corp. \u201cThat may mean increasing and improving its nuclear and missile arsenal, and then negotiating from what it may consider a position of increased leverage.\u201dTo contact the reporters on this story: Isabel Reynolds in Tokyo at ireynolds1@bloomberg.net;Jihye Lee in Seoul at jlee2352@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Shamim AdamFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",
